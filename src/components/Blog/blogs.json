While all these are true, here are some common mistakes first-time founders make when starting their company.</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Solving problems they don’t care about</strong></li></ol>\n<p>Some first-time founders try to pick a problem they think needs a solution, but it isn’t something they are willing to devote their time to solve. Since they have no deep connection to the problem, they lose motivation when working on their business.</p>\n<p>Suggestions: As first-time founders, it shouldn’t just be about what you’re building but the problem you’re solving. A problem-centric mindset will drive you toward building creative solutions and keep you from giving up if and when those solutions fail. It also ties your attention to your product users. First-time founders who are successful are those that are most passionate about the problem they are solving, not just the solution they are creating.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Helping users you don’t care about</strong></p>\n<p>Y Combinator CEO and Partner Michael Seibel spoke on the <a href=\"https://mastersofscale.com/michael-seibel-ask-uncomfortable-questions/\">experience with Justin TV and Twitch.</a> He said, “At the beginning of Justin TV we were kind of excited by the general idea of democratising live video and making it easy for anyone online to share live video with their friends but we weren’t actually terribly in love with the people who chose to use the platform to continue to grow.”</p>\n<p>That changed when Emmett Shear (co-founder of Justin TV and TwitchTV and part-time partner at venture capital firm Y Combinator) refocused the company around video game streaming. Apparently, Emmett loved gaming, and this love for video games made him love gamers and love building things for them. That was really one of the core drivers of Twitch becoming a successful company.</p>\n<p>Suggestions: Start-ups are too complex and require too much self-sacrifice to spend your time solving a problem for people you don’t care about. So, If you’re not as passionate about the users as you are about the problem, you’ll have the risk of building something that wouldn’t interest them. Still, your understanding of and commitment to the problem you’re solving and the users should remain your bedrock. Your solution will naturally change and adapt with new information about your users.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Not building a good relationship with Co-founders</strong></p>\n<p>Poor relationships often span from either choosing a co-founder you don’t know well or not being fully transparent with your co-founder. Again, Startups are complex, so it’ll be nice to have a good pre-existing relationship with your co-founder. This way, you can have a sense of how you’ll get through the hard times together and whether you work well together.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Use a <a href=\"https://harperjames.co.uk/article/co-founder-relationships/\">founders agreement</a> to protect your business from a co-founder relationship breakdown. This agreement will help you have transparent and honest conversations with them about typical topics like performance, goals, and roles that are common to creating issues amongst co-founders. Also, a startup needs to be flexible, not rigid. So, make sure that when you join with a co-founder, neither of you is entirely obsessed with the product or the idea. Ego can come in, and one of you may want to blindly follow your idea instead of being flexible when change occurs or things don’t go as planned.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Launching too slowly</strong></p>\n<p>Most first-time founders make the mistake of delaying the launch of their product or idea because they think they’re not ready. The day you launch is not as significant to your users as it is to you. Do you remember the day Snapchat, Apple, Instagram, Uber, or Lyft launched their product or idea? In truth, you can never immediately finish your product or idea development, and excessive perfectionism sometimes leads to time wastage in creating a product that your customers may not need.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> There’s no brand until you build it and put it out there. And until you get your product in front of customers, you can’t validate whether it’s solving your problem. If you’re not too sure about your product or idea stance, recruiting beta users is the next best thing. Stripe, now a $5 billion startup, did precisely that. They had an elementary beta sign-up page that helped recruit people to test their products. They used the ‘Collision Installation’ method to get their first few users. So, It is better to share your product with your customers; this allows your customers to provide feedback that will shape your final product.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Rushing to raise Venture Capital without clear goals</strong></p>\n<p>As a first-time founder, if you’re looking for capital, you’ll get it. However, one question the first-time founders fail to ask themselves is if they should focus on growing their product or idea or if they should focus on fundraising. The trick is that you can’t do both simultaneously; you’re either fundraising or growing a business. And if you’re keen to <a href=\"https://www.hive.org/entrepreneurship/raise-venture-capital/\">raise venture capital</a>, you’ll need to balance speed with the right match — don’t jump at the first most extensive check.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> Your VC relationship is often like a marriage, and every VC is always looking for the next Facebook or Airbnb that pushes for a growth-at-all-cost model to increase their chances. So, instead of going to potential investors without any apparent business blueprint, start operations by either bootstrapping to attract investors since you’ll already have a full-proof business plan to present. After you’ve bootstrapped for as long as you need to develop your product and prove that users are actively using your product, you are ready for capital.</p>\n<p>For every investor engagement, consider asking yourself questions like ask yourself questions like:</p>\n<p>i. How much capital do you want to raise?</p>\n<p>ii. Does it get your product to GA?</p>\n<p>iii. Does it get your first batch of customers?</p>\n<p>iv. Does it allow you to hire a time?</p>\n<p>v. Can you generate 10, 15, and 20x returns for your investor</p>\n<p>vi. What does the exit of your business look like?</p>\n<p>These questions will help you set clear goals that can result in a strong partnership that will reap benefits as your company scales. As first-time founders, finding a VC partner who will put in the time to provide thoughtful guidance and mentorship is also advised.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Trying to do everything alone without proper prioritisation</strong></p>\n<p>The actual work of startups is pushing a product, getting it into users’ hands and seeing if they like it, then iterating and proving it. However, First-time founders can spend around <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/is-it-time-to-outsource-human-resources/217866\">40%</a> of their working time wearing many hats and doing tasks that don’t generate income.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> Pick your favourite hat. If you enjoy speaking with prospects, signing agreements, and pitching decks, focus on that area while you delegate other responsibilities to co-founders and team members.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you can work on all these mistakes once you have the right team, business plan, and go-to-market strategy. So, If you’re trying to improve the odds of your startup being successful generally, try to minimise these mistakes.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a2c4a417c884\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

So how do you market your early-stage start-up for sustainable growth? Since marketing for start-ups is unique, this guide provides some marketing tips for founders.</p>\n<p>The most significant difference between marketing for start-ups and marketing for larger organisations is resources and priorities. As a marketer in a start-up team of 10, there’s a limitation to how much time, budget and resources can be invested in buying people to be interested in what your start-up is offering. A lot of emphasis is also placed on what aspect of the business should be prioritised to help that start-up reach its goals.</p>\n<p>In the start-up space, starting marketing before you launch helps you validate your idea, build a product for users, and get early traction for your product. Here are a few start-up tips every founder must know before launching into marketing.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Distil Your Start-up Vision and Goals</strong></p>\n<p>Every start-up vision has to be put in a way that will inspire potential product users to use your product. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinemoorman/2012/07/10/why-apple-is-a-great-marketer/?sh=6e80b8b1297d\">Apple</a> is an excellent example of a company that distilled its vision and goals into selling its “why” they do what they do. Unlike other computers, Apple pushes humanity forward and challenges the status quo with everything they do and how they do that. They were able to properly craft their message and put their brand message in a form that everybody can grasp very quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Market Dynamics Goes Alongside Market Size</strong></p>\n<p>It’s tempting to look at an industry and say, “that could be a huge market.” But the airline industry is a huge market, yet the net profitability of that industry is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/232513/net-profit-of-commercial-airlines-worldwide/\">negative</a> compared to that of fintech which is <a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fintech-stats\">$179 billion</a> and is predicted to reach $213 billion by 2024. A bad market always beats a good marketing strategy, so, It’s not just how big the market opportunity is, you also need to consider if the dynamics in that market could yield a profitable and valuable company before you start investing in marketing. Google is a great example. They went after a massive, existing market and made it into a much bigger market with a great product.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Early Adopters Are One of The Best Start-up Outbound Marketers</strong></p>\n<p>Almost <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/early-adopter.asp\">13.5%</a> of the total population makes up for the early adopters, and these are the people that’ll provide the core feedback for your initial launch and help scale profitability. Targeting the mass market most often doesn’t work because people resist change and are not receptive to products/services that early adopters or innovators do not already recommend. So, owning the majority marketshare means that your initial launch strategy and messaging must appeal to innovators and early adopters. Once you have several case studies, testimonials, and respected innovators singing your praises, it’s time to approach the majority, and then the laggards will follow.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Building Marketing into Your Product</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://openviewpartners.com/blog/going-viral-how-dropbox-used-a-product-led-growth-strategy-to-hit-10b-in-only-10-years/\">Dropbox</a> is a perfect example. While developing their product, they tested traditional ad strategies and found they wouldn’t work for their business. They were acquiring new customers for $300 when their product cost only $99. That’s when they <a href=\"https://openviewpartners.com/blog/going-viral-how-dropbox-used-a-product-led-growth-strategy-to-hit-10b-in-only-10-years/\">focused on building viral marketing into their product </a>with a referral program. With little or no advertising spending, Dropbox saw its user base go from about 100,000 to over 4 million users in less than 15 months. That translates to a 4000+% increase, and their growth curve has barely tapered off ever since. Like Dropbox, companies like Paypal, Twitter, Eventbrite, Snapchat, Airbnb and Uber have made all the difference in their bottom-line growth by building marketing and virality into their product with almost no money spent on marketing. They had something in common; they either built a product worth recommending or aligned their ‘growth hack’ with the channel(s) their ideal customers use to learn about their product.</p>\n<p>To sum up, your start-up growth isn’t only related to your marketing, outreach or sales but to the product itself. As you try to position your product, the things you learn should also impact the product itself and the roadmap. That said, start-up marketing is not an expense. It’s an investment which includes a lot of trial and error. It’s easy to get caught up in multiple marketing strategies, but when facing a demanding business environment, it’s essential to keep things lean and focused on understanding what is delivering ROI.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9b7d6307e538\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

It’s typically given to startups with less than $1 million in revenue. Usually, seed funds are given to startups by angel investors or other accredited investors, who have had previous success in the field. It is the first round of investment that a company raises from private investors. It can be used to fund product development and marketing, as well as for hiring additional staff.</p>\n<p>Seed round funding is typically aimed at companies that have just launched their product or service and have no customers. Seed funding is a central part of the early stage venture capital (VC) fundraising process. It is a relatively small amount of money that provides the seed investor with an opportunity to test the viability of your idea but does not give them full ownership of the business.</p>\n<h3>Types of seed funding</h3>\n<p>Seed funding comes in many forms and may be provided by friends and family, angel investors, venture capitalists, accelerators, incubators or crowdfunding.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends and Family:</strong> Friends and family are the most common source of seed funding for new companies. They usually provide the startup with a small amount of money, often in exchange for equity or other benefits. This can be a good way to get started, but it’s not always the best option. It’s important to remember that you’re asking friends and family members to put their own money at risk by investing in your venture — they may be unable to afford to do so if things don’t work out as expected. Friends and family are also not likely to have enough experience with financial issues or legal issues related to the startup’s operations. In addition, there’s no guarantee that they’ll be able to help you find investors who will give you more money than they invested in your company.</p>\n<p><strong>Angel Investors:</strong> Angel investors play an important role in growing a startup as they can provide a significant amount of financial support and guidance. An angel investor is often an individual who has made a fortune through successful investments and therefore has the time, resources and expertise to invest in new companies. They will often invest their own money in exchange for a stake in your company, although some angels may also be looking for returns from the company once it has been successful such as dividends. Angel investors usually invest less than $1 million dollars in a company. However, sometimes individuals can invest more if they believe that the company is a good fit for their investment portfolio. Angel Investors</p>\n<p><strong>Venture Capital:</strong> Venture capital is the type of seed funding that requires investors to put up money in exchange for share ownership in the company. The term ‘venture’ refers to the fact that venture capitalists are typically looking to invest in companies that will grow quickly and have big impacts on society.</p>\n<p>Venture capital firms typically have a portfolio of companies, and they seek out high-potential startups with the potential to become industry leaders. They have access to significant amounts of capital and access to more sophisticated financial services than most angel investors. In exchange for investing money in startups, venture capitalists take a stake in a company — typically about 20% or 30% — which gives them a seat on its board or allows them to nominate board members themselves. They may also be able to negotiate different types of compensation packages with companies depending on how well they perform over time (for example, if there’s an acquisition or sale).</p>\n<p><strong>Crowdfunding:</strong> Crowdfunding is an alternative method for sourcing seed capital from individuals who want to invest in startups but don’t know much about investing or business development. Crowdfunding platforms allow people from all over the world to invest in startups they believe in through online platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, which then pay out investors’ money once projects reach certain milestones or goals have been met (typically within 90 days).</p>\n<p><strong>Incubators and Accelerators:</strong> These are two very similar types of seed funding which aim to provide startups with access to resources such as mentorship and assistance in finding investors. There are many incubators around the world including Silicon Valley based accelerators such as Y Combinator, TechStars and Betahaus.</p>\n<p>Accelerators usually provide a space for startups to work on their product or service while they are still at an early stage so that they can get feedback from other people in the industry. This is often referred to as the ‘incubator’ phase where startups receive funding, advice and guidance on how they can improve themselves before they move onto the next phase of their growth process which is often called the ‘growth’ or ‘scale up’ phase</p>\n<h3>When do startups raise funds?</h3>\n<p>It’s been a common question for startups, but it’s one with no simple answer. Some are raising as soon as they can, while others need more time and experience. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself these questions:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Problem Validation</strong></li></ol>\n<p>This is the most popular reason for raising money. founders want to make sure their idea is worth pursuing before taking out loans or taking on investors. It’s also a good reason for early-stage companies that are still trying to figure out what they want to do. If you’re not sure whether your idea is worth pursuing, it’s better to wait until you’ve validated the idea. If your company is going to succeed, it will show up in the data. But if it doesn’t work out and you end up with no product or service, then there was never anything worth doing in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>2. MVP</strong></p>\n<p>When you’re ready to raise money, you need to make sure your product or service is ready for customer feedback. You should have a minimum viable product (MVP) that’s good enough to test with customers. Even if you plan on raising money for a minimum viable product, you still want it to be as simple as possible. That way, when you start selling the product, it will be easy for people to buy it and use it.</p>\n<p>In order for your startup to be successful, customers need to be able to see how much value they get from using your product or service. This means that when someone buys your product or service, they should be able to immediately see how much better their life is because of it. If someone doesn’t notice any benefit after buying something from you, then they probably won’t use it again and will more likely refer to someone else who might buy more stuff from you in the future. You have to build something people will pay for before you can tell them how much they’ll pay for it. That means building out your product or service before asking investors for more cash.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Readiness to Scale</strong></p>\n<p>The best time to raise money is when you are ready to scale the business. Raising money too early can be a bad idea because it will force you to make changes that you don’t want to make. For example, if you have just launched your product and are getting traction, but not enough to justify a full-time employee, raising money now will mean hiring someone full-time who isn’t able to do much more than answer customer support emails and help with marketing. If that person gets sick or has a family emergency at home, it’s going to affect your ability to scale up quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Traction</strong></p>\n<p>To answer this question, you need to determine if your company is profitable and cash-flow positive. If not, it will take time and money to grow. However, if you are profitable and cash-flow positive, then raising money might be the right thing for your business.</p>\n<p>Startups don’t need to raise money immediately. The goal is to build a strong business with enough revenue to support growth without raising equity rounds. A good way to determine whether or not you are ready for an equity round is by evaluating the financials of your business and asking yourself if you would be able to pay yourself from the profits from that year’s sales assuming no outside investors. If the answer is yes, then you’re ready. If not, then it might be time to raise some money from investors so that you can expand your operations and hire more people towards your vision for growth.</p>\n<h3>Stages of Fundraising</h3>\n<p>Seed funding is typically for around 12–18 months. This is the time it takes for you to develop your product and build a team of people that can support you in growing your business. A typical seed round has 3 main stages:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Development Stage:</strong> You will spend this time developing the product and building out your team of specialists.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Exploration Stage:</strong> During this stage, you will be testing out your idea with customers/clients and finding out what works and what doesn’t work with your product/service.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Acquisition Stage: </strong>Once you have a good understanding of what works and what doesn’t work in terms of sales, you can start seeking acquisition partners who will help take your product/service to scale.</p>\n<h3>Raising Seed</h3>\n<p>There are a few ways to raise seed. We will discuss the more easier methods.</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Start with your network</strong></li></ol>\n<p>The best way to get started is by asking for advice from people you already know. Start with your family, friends and colleagues. Even if they aren’t in the industry you’re planning on entering, they can still help you by providing valuable feedback about your idea and any possible competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Create a Financial Plan</strong></p>\n<p>Before approaching investors, make sure you have a solid financial plan that shows how much money you’ll need to raise and how much time it will take to build the product or service that you’re hoping to fund. You want to be ready before approaching investors so they can see that there’s potential in your idea and that they can trust the team behind it.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Research Potential Investors</strong></p>\n<p>You can use a service like Angellist or Crunchbase to find investors interested in your industry. Next, research potential investors for your seed funding round by going through Angellist or Crunchbase again if necessary. You should then set up meetings with the people who are interested in investing in your business so that they can ask questions about its operations and financials. Hence, they know what they are getting into before they invest their money.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Seed raising can seem overwhelming, especially for the entrepreneur who may not have run a company before. It’s imperative to take time and make educated decisions about whom you are pitching to, your financial plan, and the expectations of investors.</p>\n<p>In the end, some investors just need to see that passion for your idea and a team of people who have dedicated their time and energy to follow through on that dream. That passion is usually enough for seed-level funding. Just go outside and spread the word about your project or product. With a bit of luck, it will help you raise your seed round.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ee7d00e6c58f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

They were able to create an environment where their target market would feel comfortable. It was only after they had figured out how to reach out to their ideal customer base did they start looking into other ways of marketing themselves.</p>\n<p>First, they built an email list before they had anything to sell. Airbnb built an email list and then sent out regular updates about their progress. Then, when they were ready to launch their service, those who signed up received an email inviting them to use the site for free during its initial beta period and giving them access to discounted rates if they booked something through Airbnb versus being hosted by a friend or family member.</p>\n<p>Airbnb added beds to a conference in 2007 after the venue didn’t have enough rooms. Airbnb’s first customers were people traveling through New York City and it was all thanks to a Meetup. In early 2007, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia hosted a Meetup for people who had come into town for some tech conference and needed a place to stay. They had to put people up in an apartment and charge $20 per night for guests to stay there.</p>\n<p>This strategy had several benefits: it helped build trust with potential customers, and it allowed AirBnB to scale quickly once its website did go live because all the early adopters already knew about it.</p>\n<p>Airbnb founders Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, also went door-to-door in New York showing people the value of Airbnb set out to show people how much money they could save by using Airbnb and how easy it was to use the website. They took their pitch directly to people by going door-to-door. They showed people how much money they could make by using Airbnb and even offered to cover their first two nights of hosting if they used their service once that week.</p>\n<p>The founders of Uber, on the other hand, wanted to get people excited about trying the service, so they started by giving away coupons. They also invited journalists to test the service and spread the word through social media.</p>\n<p>Uber then contacted journalists who wrote about startup tech companies or other transportation services and invited them to try it. They wanted to get the word out, but more importantly, they wanted to test the service. If a journalist liked Uber, they might mention it in an article and other people would come on board. Then Uber could start charging for their rides, which would bring in money for the company and help them grow even faster.</p>\n<p>Uber then used influencers and celebrities, who shared the app with their followers on social media and other platforms. Celebrities are perfect influencers because they’re more likely to be trusted as experts, and they’re well-known for their particular expertise in whatever field they’re known for. Celebrities are also usually able to reach millions of people with one post on social media which means that when you partner with them, it can get your brand exposure very quickly.</p>\n<p>The next step was to get people to try out the service. When the service was available in a new city, they would send free credits to customers in that area ahead of time so they could test it out. They also gave away credits to local influencers, businesses, and media contacts.</p>\n<p>They also offered promotions where you could spend a lesser amount with Uber on rides instead of taxis or public transit which helped reduce costs for users. And when the service launched in your city, you could use your first ride as an Uber credit for free.</p>\n<blockquote>They used new technology like QR codes and mobile apps to make requesting a ride quick and easy. The company made it easy for customers to request a ride. The idea was simple: when you needed a ride, you’d open the Uber app, select your destination, and request a car using your phone’s GPS location. The driver would then be notified of your order through their own Uber app — which also tracked their location in order to make sure they were nearby when you needed them — and would arrive at the requested time.</blockquote>\n<p>There are many more ways to launch a new product and build initial growth; first, find the best strategy for your business, what’s important is that you keep experimenting until something works. This strategy has worked for Uber as they grew from 11million users in 2015 to 118million users in 2021; also for Airbnb as they grew from 6million users in 2012 to 150million users in 2018.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c2ec9a95650e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

The company made it easy for customers to request a ride. The idea was simple: when you needed a ride, you’d open the Uber app, select your destination, and request a car using your phone’s GPS location. The driver would then be notified of your order through their own Uber app — which also tracked their location in order to make sure they were nearby when you needed them — and would arrive at the requested time.</blockquote>\n<p>There are many more ways to launch a new product and build initial growth; first, find the best strategy for your business, what’s important is that you keep experimenting until something works. This strategy has worked for Uber as they grew from 11million users in 2015 to 118million users in 2021; also for Airbnb as they grew from 6million users in 2012 to 150million users in 2018.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c2ec9a95650e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

As a developing country, China is still one of Africa’s largest bilateral trading partners and source of foreign direct investment. Its investment has helped spur infrastructure development and economic growth, especially since the end of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>China’s relationship with Africa spans six centuries, as they started engaging with each other on official and diplomatic terms. During this period, China’s intent was draped in the warm embrace of openness, exploration, investment, and trade expansion in Africa. China’s need for oil, other resources, and a market to sell its products has driven its investment in Africa, using economic relations with Africa to achieve its development goals.</p>\n<p>These reasons gave many Chinese companies access to almost all African markets, and today there are more than 1,000 of them operating in Africa. Within just a few decades, China became a vital political and economic power in the continent and Africa’s go-to nation for development finance.</p>\n<h3>The ‘Debt-trap’</h3>\n<p>Although Africa’s debt crisis has been around for years, the difference between the 1980s debt crisis and that of now is that the former was of concessional debt. These debts were loaned by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, or other multilateral institutions giving African countries better-than-market terms for repayment. But today’s debt case with China is that most of Africa’s debt is private debt owed to private companies and banks like EXIMBANK and CDB.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PT9iZpVtfmzqH6OU\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*N2guKuHIezHFeaGf\"></figure><p>While many in Africa view China’s investment favourably, other countries and continents see it with many strings attached. Many Chinese companies made a ready offer of substantial loans for investing and building infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, and ports to aid their industrialisation. And due to a severe lack of infrastructure, the desperate need for modern transport links, and a dire need to boost their economic growth and global competitiveness in African countries, it was hard for them to reject China’s ready offer.</p>\n<p>Hence, African countries increasingly and constantly look to China for loans. China saw this as a good bedrock for a beneficial ‘win-win’ economic relationship with African countries. But, over time, critics say that major infrastructure projects carried out by Chinese companies in Africa are too expensive, and the borrowing spree has come under scrutiny in recent years. As a result of this dependency, host countries (Africa) are burdened and entrapped with enormous loan debts they can’t hope to repay. According to an estimate from World Bank data, China accounted for <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/bargaining-beijing-tale-two-borrowers\">57% of low-income countries’ bilateral debt</a> in 2020, holding 18% to 24% of African external debt in 2021. Their loans accounted for 30% of African countries’ debt payments that year. According to <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/36289/9781464818004.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y\">World Bank figures,</a> the external debt stock of ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’ doubled throughout the 2010s, from $305 billion in 2010 to $705 billion in 2020.</p>\n<p>While China itself is still an emerging economy with a per capita income of $10,153 as of 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">CLA Database</a> estimates the continent has signed 1,188 loan commitments worth $160 billion with African governments and their state-owned enterprises between 2000 and 2020. And, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5652847de4b033f56d2bdc29/t/605cb1891cb0ff5747b12167/1616687497984/BP+4+-+Acker%2C+Brautigam+-+20+Years+of+Data+on+African+Lending.pdf\">80% of these loans</a> were on commercial terms to finance economic and social infrastructure projects like transport, power, telecoms, and water, secure commodity supplies, and develop its global network of infrastructure projects, the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>\n<h3>African States in debt to China</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.worldfinance.com/special-reports/is-a-new-debt-crisis-mounting-in-africa\">World Finance</a>, from 2012 to 2017, Chinese loans to countries in sub-Saharan Africa grew tenfold to more than $10bn per year, with an estimated 24% of African governments’ external debt owed to China, according to the <a href=\"https://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Briefing_09.18.pdf\">Jubilee Debt Campaign</a>. How did this happen? During the 2008 financial crisis, when global interest rates were low and money was cheap, these African countries sought greater returns using riskier investments, including African sovereign debt, by taking on more loans to fund infrastructure and other development projects. And for some reasons best known to the Chinese government, China focuses on lending to resource-rich and strategic countries in Africa.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the China-Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at John Hopkins University identified 17 African countries with risky debt exposure to China, potentially unable to repay their loans. Eight include Zambia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Angola. Djibouti, the Republic of Congo, and Zambia remain most at risk of debt distress from these Chinese loans.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Oi2uyFK71d03Pand\"></figure><p>As of 2020, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">Chinese Loans to Africa Database</a>, The Democratic Republic of Congo has an estimated debt of $2.3 billion owed to China, with CHEXIM being their primary lender of over <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">$1.0 billion and $673 million</a> going into transport and power. Ghana has an estimated deficit of $5.3 billion that it owes to China, allowing China to finance over <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/chinas-2-billion-ghana-deal-fears-over-debt-influence-environment.html\">$2 billion</a> worth of rail, road, and bridge networks in Ghana in exchange for access to 5% of Ghana’s bauxite reserves — a crucial source of aluminium.</p>\n<p>The most recent summary of Nigeria’s external debt stock shows that Nigeria owed China about $7.3 billion. Being one of China’s most prominent debtors, Zambia has an external debt estimated to be <a href=\"https://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Briefing_09.18.pdf\">30% of its GDP</a> to China, reaching nearly <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">$10.1 billion</a> of debt in 2018, up from $1.9bn in 2011. Kenya owes China an estimated $7.9 billion in debt, with $6 billion funding infrastructure projects across the East African country.</p>\n<p>Beijing also accounted for nearly half of Ethiopia’s external debt and lent at least $13.7 billion to Ethiopia between 2000 and 2018. Angola’s debt owed to China currently stands at $42.6 billion. At the last estimate, every Angolan owes $754 to China, which is more than seven times what’s owed to its other creditor, Israel — in this case, each Angolan owes Israel $106.</p>\n<h3>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, China is reportedly guilty of aggressive loans with terms that favour the Chinese government unfairly. For example, the contract between Kenya and China to construct the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge railway mega-project shows that <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20190114-kenya-mombasa-port-china-debt-default\">the country could lose the Mombasa port</a> to the Chinese government if the National Railway Corporation defaults on the payment of $ 2.27 billion.</p>\n<p>Africa’s second-largest producer of copper, Zambia, could lose state-owned assets such as power-producer Zesco to the Chinese if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/11/china-steps-in-as-zambia-runs-out-of-loan-options\">country defaults on its loans</a>. Angola, which is Africa’s 2nd most significant oil producer, may lose most of its precious natural resources since they are going towards repaying Chinese debts. Its ability to repay the debt is also largely dependent on the oil price.</p>\n<h3>COVID-19 Impact</h3>\n<p>The pandemic also worsened Africa’s debt crisis. As COVID-19 spread across the world, including the African continent, several African leaders have pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting unresolved underlying tensions and creating more economic strains, especially in line with their debt burden with China. And according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 20 low-income African countries were in financial distress in the second half of 2021, due mainly to their debts to China, as It’s still unclear how much money Africa owes China.</p>\n<p>Most of China’s loans to African countries were designed to be repaid using natural resources and commodities such as oil, bauxite, or copper instead of cash. Unfortunately, during the early period of the pandemic, until now, sub-Saharan African countries faced a recession for the first time in 25 years, which made prices for natural resources and comedies drop. So, when the costs of these resources dropped, repaying loans and restructuring their debt was difficult.</p>\n<p>The opacity of China’s dealings in Africa and the lack of transparency exhibited by the Chinese and these African countries also contributed to their unresolved debt problems. Since African countries also borrowed more from private lenders than official bilateral loans, the financial details and terms of its loans and commitments to the continent typically remain vague, as there’s a big vacuum of information and unreported liabilities with stakeholders on both sides. So, it has been difficult for international agencies such as the World Bank and the IMF to help them restructure and renegotiate their debts.</p>\n<h3>China’s Agreement</h3>\n<p>We should know that with China’s increasing involvement with Africa and its commitment to providing loans for large-scale projects, any solution to Africa’s debt problems must first address its relationship with Beijing and private Chinese companies operating on the continent.</p>\n<p>However, Chinese banks and other countries have been stepping in to restructure African debt for the past two decades. Still, this action requires <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2022/04/07/restructuring-debt-of-poorer-nations-requires-more-efficient-coordination/\">more efficient coordination.</a> China has also been engaging in <a href=\"https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/ODI_emerging_analysis_Chinas_lending_landscape_and_approach_to_debt_relief_Oct_BKPn1Ix.pdf\">renegotiating debt commitments</a> and, in some cases agreeing to deferrals on payment deadlines with indebted countries. So far, China has forgiven over $10bn in debt to Africa, and this year, China has engaged in debt renegotiations with 15 countries globally, with nearly half of those being African. Since the pandemic, China’s debt relief has fallen into four distinct categories <a href=\"http://www.sais-cari.org/debt-relief\">according to CARI:</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Official bilateral creditor debt relief, as part of the G20 effort.</li>\n<li>Continued cancellation of interest-free loans that matured in 2020 under the FOCAC program.</li>\n<li>Ad-hoc debt relief by Chinese commercial banks.</li>\n<li>Contributions to the IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For its part, Angola’s debt renegotiation resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-angola-imf-idUSKCN26C2CP\">three-year deferral</a> on principal payments of its $6.2 billion loans. Angola will receive deferrals and interest-free aid of about or more than $3.9 billion in debt relief from Chinese banks from 2020 to 2023. China cancelled Botswana’s debt; this amounted to about $2.2 million. China has suspended $468 million in debt in Zambia, $227 million in Kenya, and $190 million in debt in Ethiopia. In March 2021, China cancelled $37.5 million of debt for Mozambique. China’s Export-Import Bank of China (<a href=\"https://www.lusakatimes.com/2020/11/17/exim-bank-of-china-accepts-to-defer-interest-payments-on-zambias-sovereign-loans/\">EXIM CHINA</a>) also forgave $110 million in loans to Zambia and $<a href=\"https://chinaafricaproject.com/2020/11/17/china-exim-bank-defers-zambian-loan-while-lusaka-and-bondholders-go-at-each-other-following-debt-default/\">378 million</a> to Kenya.</p>\n<p>The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are pushing for debt forgiveness to encourage a post-coronavirus economic recovery. Still, for China, simple debt forgiveness hardly encourages responsible borrowing from African governments down the road because they worry that their debt forgiveness will improve their debt ratio and free them to borrow more debts from international financiers.</p>\n<p>Also, the Chinese government is now in a critical financial position because of its foreign lending. If a debt default in which African countries cannot meet the debt repayment, China would bear substantial financial losses and pressure from its citizens. For this reason, they are unlikely to take a unilateral approach to debt forgiveness, especially on concessional loans and commercial loans, which constitute the majority of African debts owed to China.</p>\n<p>These short-term debt relief agreement efforts give these African countries a period to get out of economic difficulties and avoid a pile of bad debt. So, as a member of the G-20 alongside the IMF and World Bank, China may likely participate in that collective debt relief effort such as postponement of loan payments, debt restructuring and renegotiation, and debt/equity swap rather than the blanket relief. If these short-term arrangements do not help the domestic economies of debtor countries improve, that could signal danger for Beijing’s balance sheets.</p>\n<h3>Improving the Debt Situation</h3>\n<p>Africa can also improve its debt and independence to the Chinese government by first building an economy to expedite its growth, expedite its size, and raise domestic resources to advance its development plan. Improving their debt situation is also embedded in them being transparent with their debt to reform their debt management. Africa should adopt comprehensive debt data disclosure requirements following publicised, predictable and binding legal procedures in incurring new financial obligations. These financial obligations should include loan repayment arrangements; an example is the recourse-backed loans.</p>\n<p>They should disclose their loan amount and contractual terms to their creditors and the multilateral financial institutions while making the information publicly available through national platforms to hold relevant decision-makers accountable. Now, Transparency alone won’t improve the debt situation and ensure responsible borrowing. But, good governance that includes accountability, reasoned decision-making, and practical institutional arrangements will help African countries beat the debt situation.</p>\n<p>Debt Independence also isn’t expected to happen overnight because some of China’s loans go a long way in building infrastructures and encouraging economic growth. Nonetheless, there should be a specific limit to Africa’s aid from China. It’s also essential that African countries leverage their natural resources rather than selling them out — She needs to trade with itself. Science and technology are also another basis for the transformation of African countries. Thanks to some already constructed infrastructures and some tech systems put in place by the Chinese, Africa only needs to build expertise in these areas. It wouldn’t be easy and may not even guarantee complete independence from China, but it will go a long way.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4e46bfc458c4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

According to <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/36289/9781464818004.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y\">World Bank figures,</a> the external debt stock of ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’ doubled throughout the 2010s, from $305 billion in 2010 to $705 billion in 2020.</p>\n<p>While China itself is still an emerging economy with a per capita income of $10,153 as of 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">CLA Database</a> estimates the continent has signed 1,188 loan commitments worth $160 billion with African governments and their state-owned enterprises between 2000 and 2020. And, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5652847de4b033f56d2bdc29/t/605cb1891cb0ff5747b12167/1616687497984/BP+4+-+Acker%2C+Brautigam+-+20+Years+of+Data+on+African+Lending.pdf\">80% of these loans</a> were on commercial terms to finance economic and social infrastructure projects like transport, power, telecoms, and water, secure commodity supplies, and develop its global network of infrastructure projects, the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>\n<h3>African States in debt to China</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.worldfinance.com/special-reports/is-a-new-debt-crisis-mounting-in-africa\">World Finance</a>, from 2012 to 2017, Chinese loans to countries in sub-Saharan Africa grew tenfold to more than $10bn per year, with an estimated 24% of African governments’ external debt owed to China, according to the <a href=\"https://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Briefing_09.18.pdf\">Jubilee Debt Campaign</a>. How did this happen? During the 2008 financial crisis, when global interest rates were low and money was cheap, these African countries sought greater returns using riskier investments, including African sovereign debt, by taking on more loans to fund infrastructure and other development projects. And for some reasons best known to the Chinese government, China focuses on lending to resource-rich and strategic countries in Africa.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the China-Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at John Hopkins University identified 17 African countries with risky debt exposure to China, potentially unable to repay their loans. Eight include Zambia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Angola. Djibouti, the Republic of Congo, and Zambia remain most at risk of debt distress from these Chinese loans.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Oi2uyFK71d03Pand\"></figure><p>As of 2020, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">Chinese Loans to Africa Database</a>, The Democratic Republic of Congo has an estimated debt of $2.3 billion owed to China, with CHEXIM being their primary lender of over <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">$1.0 billion and $673 million</a> going into transport and power. Ghana has an estimated deficit of $5.3 billion that it owes to China, allowing China to finance over <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/chinas-2-billion-ghana-deal-fears-over-debt-influence-environment.html\">$2 billion</a> worth of rail, road, and bridge networks in Ghana in exchange for access to 5% of Ghana’s bauxite reserves — a crucial source of aluminium.</p>\n<p>The most recent summary of Nigeria’s external debt stock shows that Nigeria owed China about $7.3 billion. Being one of China’s most prominent debtors, Zambia has an external debt estimated to be <a href=\"https://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Briefing_09.18.pdf\">30% of its GDP</a> to China, reaching nearly <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinese-loans-to-africa-database/\">$10.1 billion</a> of debt in 2018, up from $1.9bn in 2011. Kenya owes China an estimated $7.9 billion in debt, with $6 billion funding infrastructure projects across the East African country.</p>\n<p>Beijing also accounted for nearly half of Ethiopia’s external debt and lent at least $13.7 billion to Ethiopia between 2000 and 2018. Angola’s debt owed to China currently stands at $42.6 billion. At the last estimate, every Angolan owes $754 to China, which is more than seven times what’s owed to its other creditor, Israel — in this case, each Angolan owes Israel $106.</p>\n<h3>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, China is reportedly guilty of aggressive loans with terms that favour the Chinese government unfairly. For example, the contract between Kenya and China to construct the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge railway mega-project shows that <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20190114-kenya-mombasa-port-china-debt-default\">the country could lose the Mombasa port</a> to the Chinese government if the National Railway Corporation defaults on the payment of $ 2.27 billion.</p>\n<p>Africa’s second-largest producer of copper, Zambia, could lose state-owned assets such as power-producer Zesco to the Chinese if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/11/china-steps-in-as-zambia-runs-out-of-loan-options\">country defaults on its loans</a>. Angola, which is Africa’s 2nd most significant oil producer, may lose most of its precious natural resources since they are going towards repaying Chinese debts. Its ability to repay the debt is also largely dependent on the oil price.</p>\n<h3>COVID-19 Impact</h3>\n<p>The pandemic also worsened Africa’s debt crisis. As COVID-19 spread across the world, including the African continent, several African leaders have pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting unresolved underlying tensions and creating more economic strains, especially in line with their debt burden with China. And according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 20 low-income African countries were in financial distress in the second half of 2021, due mainly to their debts to China, as It’s still unclear how much money Africa owes China.</p>\n<p>Most of China’s loans to African countries were designed to be repaid using natural resources and commodities such as oil, bauxite, or copper instead of cash. Unfortunately, during the early period of the pandemic, until now, sub-Saharan African countries faced a recession for the first time in 25 years, which made prices for natural resources and comedies drop. So, when the costs of these resources dropped, repaying loans and restructuring their debt was difficult.</p>\n<p>The opacity of China’s dealings in Africa and the lack of transparency exhibited by the Chinese and these African countries also contributed to their unresolved debt problems. Since African countries also borrowed more from private lenders than official bilateral loans, the financial details and terms of its loans and commitments to the continent typically remain vague, as there’s a big vacuum of information and unreported liabilities with stakeholders on both sides. So, it has been difficult for international agencies such as the World Bank and the IMF to help them restructure and renegotiate their debts.</p>\n<h3>China’s Agreement</h3>\n<p>We should know that with China’s increasing involvement with Africa and its commitment to providing loans for large-scale projects, any solution to Africa’s debt problems must first address its relationship with Beijing and private Chinese companies operating on the continent.</p>\n<p>However, Chinese banks and other countries have been stepping in to restructure African debt for the past two decades. Still, this action requires <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2022/04/07/restructuring-debt-of-poorer-nations-requires-more-efficient-coordination/\">more efficient coordination.</a> China has also been engaging in <a href=\"https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/ODI_emerging_analysis_Chinas_lending_landscape_and_approach_to_debt_relief_Oct_BKPn1Ix.pdf\">renegotiating debt commitments</a> and, in some cases agreeing to deferrals on payment deadlines with indebted countries. So far, China has forgiven over $10bn in debt to Africa, and this year, China has engaged in debt renegotiations with 15 countries globally, with nearly half of those being African. Since the pandemic, China’s debt relief has fallen into four distinct categories <a href=\"http://www.sais-cari.org/debt-relief\">according to CARI:</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Official bilateral creditor debt relief, as part of the G20 effort.</li>\n<li>Continued cancellation of interest-free loans that matured in 2020 under the FOCAC program.</li>\n<li>Ad-hoc debt relief by Chinese commercial banks.</li>\n<li>Contributions to the IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For its part, Angola’s debt renegotiation resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-angola-imf-idUSKCN26C2CP\">three-year deferral</a> on principal payments of its $6.2 billion loans. Angola will receive deferrals and interest-free aid of about or more than $3.9 billion in debt relief from Chinese banks from 2020 to 2023. China cancelled Botswana’s debt; this amounted to about $2.2 million. China has suspended $468 million in debt in Zambia, $227 million in Kenya, and $190 million in debt in Ethiopia. In March 2021, China cancelled $37.5 million of debt for Mozambique. China’s Export-Import Bank of China (<a href=\"https://www.lusakatimes.com/2020/11/17/exim-bank-of-china-accepts-to-defer-interest-payments-on-zambias-sovereign-loans/\">EXIM CHINA</a>) also forgave $110 million in loans to Zambia and $<a href=\"https://chinaafricaproject.com/2020/11/17/china-exim-bank-defers-zambian-loan-while-lusaka-and-bondholders-go-at-each-other-following-debt-default/\">378 million</a> to Kenya.</p>\n<p>The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are pushing for debt forgiveness to encourage a post-coronavirus economic recovery. Still, for China, simple debt forgiveness hardly encourages responsible borrowing from African governments down the road because they worry that their debt forgiveness will improve their debt ratio and free them to borrow more debts from international financiers.</p>\n<p>Also, the Chinese government is now in a critical financial position because of its foreign lending. If a debt default in which African countries cannot meet the debt repayment, China would bear substantial financial losses and pressure from its citizens. For this reason, they are unlikely to take a unilateral approach to debt forgiveness, especially on concessional loans and commercial loans, which constitute the majority of African debts owed to China.</p>\n<p>These short-term debt relief agreement efforts give these African countries a period to get out of economic difficulties and avoid a pile of bad debt. So, as a member of the G-20 alongside the IMF and World Bank, China may likely participate in that collective debt relief effort such as postponement of loan payments, debt restructuring and renegotiation, and debt/equity swap rather than the blanket relief. If these short-term arrangements do not help the domestic economies of debtor countries improve, that could signal danger for Beijing’s balance sheets.</p>\n<h3>Improving the Debt Situation</h3>\n<p>Africa can also improve its debt and independence to the Chinese government by first building an economy to expedite its growth, expedite its size, and raise domestic resources to advance its development plan. Improving their debt situation is also embedded in them being transparent with their debt to reform their debt management. Africa should adopt comprehensive debt data disclosure requirements following publicised, predictable and binding legal procedures in incurring new financial obligations. These financial obligations should include loan repayment arrangements; an example is the recourse-backed loans.</p>\n<p>They should disclose their loan amount and contractual terms to their creditors and the multilateral financial institutions while making the information publicly available through national platforms to hold relevant decision-makers accountable. Now, Transparency alone won’t improve the debt situation and ensure responsible borrowing. But, good governance that includes accountability, reasoned decision-making, and practical institutional arrangements will help African countries beat the debt situation.</p>\n<p>Debt Independence also isn’t expected to happen overnight because some of China’s loans go a long way in building infrastructures and encouraging economic growth. Nonetheless, there should be a specific limit to Africa’s aid from China. It’s also essential that African countries leverage their natural resources rather than selling them out — She needs to trade with itself. Science and technology are also another basis for the transformation of African countries. Thanks to some already constructed infrastructures and some tech systems put in place by the Chinese, Africa only needs to build expertise in these areas. It wouldn’t be easy and may not even guarantee complete independence from China, but it will go a long way.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4e46bfc458c4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

In this research, we examine the issue of flight delays in Nigeria as we begin by taking a look at the history of air transport in Nigeria as well as some of the causes of flight delays and its impact on the Nigerian economy.</p>\n<p><strong>History of Air Transport in Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p>Air transportation in Nigeria started during the British colonial rule. The first aircraft landed in Kano on November 1, 1925, which involved three De Havilland DH9A aircraft belonging to the Royal Air Force, RAF. The flight, led by flight Lt. Coningham took off from Helwan, Egypt with two stopovers: Sudan, and N’djamena, Chad (which was known as Fort Lany then).</p>\n<p>Ever since, air transport has evolved from being handled/owned by the British to Nigeria having its national carrier (Nigerian Airways), to Nigeria having a fleet of domestic and international airlines operating daily in the country. However, this system has been plagued by recurrent flight delays, mainly affecting domestic flights.</p>\n<p><strong>The Nigerian Airways</strong></p>\n<p>Nigerian Airways was formed on 23rd August 1958. It was formerly known as West African Airways Corporation Nigeria Limited (WAAC Nigeria). WAAC as a company was a joint venture between the Nigerian government, Elder Dempster lines (Elder Dempster Lines was a UK shipping company that traded from 1932 to 2000), and the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The major shareholder in the company was Nigeria with 51% followed by Elder Dempster lines with 33% and BOAC with 16%.</p>\n<p>On March 25, 1961, Elder Dempster and BOAC sold their shares to the Nigerian Government making Nigeria the sole owner of the company. Unfortunately, the airline ceased operations in 2003. This was speculated to be due to incompetent management, retrogressive union activism, staff resistance to change, and corruption among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Data on Flight Operations in Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p>Nigeria has 32 airports that had 14 million passengers in 2021, despite the country having a population of 200 million people. Lagos airport alone accounts for 65% of this traffic. In 2021, the total number of domestic and international flights operated in Nigeria was 74,537 and 9,675 respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>The Normalisation of Flight Delays</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately in Nigeria, it has become the norm for domestic carriers to have flight delays. In extreme cases, even after lengthy delays, flights can be cancelled or shifted to another day, causing discomfort and additional cost to travellers. From our research, we think flight delays are caused by some of these key reasons:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Shortage of Aviation Fuel Supplies</strong></li></ol>\n<p>Aeroplanes are fueled with aviation fuel. In Nigeria, aviation fuel is both limited and costly, and this can result in flight delays. In 2016 there was a fuel shortage that caused some international airlines to suspend flights to Nigeria and other airlines had to be refuelled in neighbouring countries like Ghana. Another occurred in 2016 when the airlines complained about high fuel prices at ₦200 per litre which has more than quadrupled to over ₦700 per litre in recent times. A resolution was made in 2017 to give airline operators the licence to import aviation fuel so they can bring in cheaper products.</p>\n<p>The major issue contributing to the high cost of fuel is the high foreign exchange rate required to import fuel and the difficulties in transporting the fuel to the airports, as the pipeline system from the depot to the airport has not been fixed in two decades, so trucks have to be used to supply the products. According to experts, repairs done on the pipeline from Mosimi/Ejigbo to the MMA depot can contribute to a 20% reduction in fuel prices.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Lack of Adequate Airport Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>The capacity for check-in at the country’s major airports is far less than what is required for on-time performance. Airlines are compelled to check-in passengers travelling to a variety of destinations from a small number of check-in desks at both the Lagos and Abuja domestic terminals, resulting in large waits and delays in passenger processing. There is also a need for up-to-date technologies in Nigerian Airports. For instance, numerous carousels were non-operational during the recent Christmas season in popular airports like Lagos and Abuja, slowing down the check-in process and causing passengers to wait extended periods of time to receive their luggage.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Inadequate Technology for Air Traffic Controllers</strong></p>\n<p>An Aircraft typically waits 5 minutes at the runway’s holding point for an aircraft that just took off to reach cruise altitude before being allowed to take off. Frequently, particularly at the Lagos Airport, a plane about to take off can wait up to 15–20 minutes before being allowed to take off. These delays accumulate and cause further delays.</p>\n<p><strong>Data on Domestic Flight Delays in 2019-2021</strong></p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://ncaa.gov.ng/media-center/news/2021-executive-summary-on-international-and-domestic-flight-operations/\">annual report</a> published by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, 74,537 domestic flights were operated in 2021 which conveyed 12,050,264 passengers. 41,328 (55%) domestic flights were delayed while 542 flights were cancelled. Air peace, Overland, Azman, Dana, Max Air, and Arik Airlines had over 55% of their flights delayed in Nigeria in 2021.</p>\n<p>In 2019, 65,401 domestic flights were operated according to the annual report published by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. 37,510 domestic flights were delayed while 356 flights were cancelled.</p>\n<p><strong>Domestic Flights Delayed in 2019-2021</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Hq9ATYooPVpAWCEs\"></figure><p><strong>Data on International Flight Delays 2019–2021</strong></p>\n<p>In 2021, a total of 9,675 international flights were operated according to the annual report published by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.

In this research, we examine the issue of flight delays in Nigeria as we begin by taking a look at the history of air transport in Nigeria as well as some of the causes of flight delays and its impact on the Nigerian economy.</p>\n<p><strong>History of Air Transport in Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p>Air transportation in Nigeria started during the British colonial rule. The first aircraft landed in Kano on November 1, 1925, which involved three De Havilland DH9A aircraft belonging to the Royal Air Force, RAF. The flight, led by flight Lt. Coningham took off from Helwan, Egypt with two stopovers: Sudan, and N’djamena, Chad (which was known as Fort Lany then).</p>\n<p>Ever since, air transport has evolved from being handled/owned by the British to Nigeria having its national carrier (Nigerian Airways), to Nigeria having a fleet of domestic and international airlines operating daily in the country. However, this system has been plagued by recurrent flight delays, mainly affecting domestic flights.</p>\n<p><strong>The Nigerian Airways</strong></p>\n<p>Nigerian Airways was formed on 23rd August 1958. It was formerly known as West African Airways Corporation Nigeria Limited (WAAC Nigeria). WAAC as a company was a joint venture between the Nigerian government, Elder Dempster lines (Elder Dempster Lines was a UK shipping company that traded from 1932 to 2000), and the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The major shareholder in the company was Nigeria with 51% followed by Elder Dempster lines with 33% and BOAC with 16%.</p>\n<p>On March 25, 1961, Elder Dempster and BOAC sold their shares to the Nigerian Government making Nigeria the sole owner of the company. Unfortunately, the airline ceased operations in 2003. This was speculated to be due to incompetent management, retrogressive union activism, staff resistance to change, and corruption among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Data on Flight Operations in Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p>Nigeria has 32 airports that had 14 million passengers in 2021, despite the country having a population of 200 million people. Lagos airport alone accounts for 65% of this traffic. In 2021, the total number of domestic and international flights operated in Nigeria was 74,537 and 9,675 respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>The Normalisation of Flight Delays</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately in Nigeria, it has become the norm for domestic carriers to have flight delays. In extreme cases, even after lengthy delays, flights can be cancelled or shifted to another day, causing discomfort and additional cost to travellers. From our research, we think flight delays are caused by some of these key reasons:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Shortage of Aviation Fuel Supplies</strong></li></ol>\n<p>Aeroplanes are fueled with aviation fuel. In Nigeria, aviation fuel is both limited and costly, and this can result in flight delays. In 2016 there was a fuel shortage that caused some international airlines to suspend flights to Nigeria and other airlines had to be refuelled in neighbouring countries like Ghana. Another occurred in 2016 when the airlines complained about high fuel prices at ₦200 per litre which has more than quadrupled to over ₦700 per litre in recent times. A resolution was made in 2017 to give airline operators the licence to import aviation fuel so they can bring in cheaper products.</p>\n<p>The major issue contributing to the high cost of fuel is the high foreign exchange rate required to import fuel and the difficulties in transporting the fuel to the airports, as the pipeline system from the depot to the airport has not been fixed in two decades, so trucks have to be used to supply the products. According to experts, repairs done on the pipeline from Mosimi/Ejigbo to the MMA depot can contribute to a 20% reduction in fuel prices.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Lack of Adequate Airport Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>The capacity for check-in at the country’s major airports is far less than what is required for on-time performance. Airlines are compelled to check-in passengers travelling to a variety of destinations from a small number of check-in desks at both the Lagos and Abuja domestic terminals, resulting in large waits and delays in passenger processing. There is also a need for up-to-date technologies in Nigerian Airports. For instance, numerous carousels were non-operational during the recent Christmas season in popular airports like Lagos and Abuja, slowing down the check-in process and causing passengers to wait extended periods of time to receive their luggage.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Inadequate Technology for Air Traffic Controllers</strong></p>\n<p>An Aircraft typically waits 5 minutes at the runway’s holding point for an aircraft that just took off to reach cruise altitude before being allowed to take off. Frequently, particularly at the Lagos Airport, a plane about to take off can wait up to 15–20 minutes before being allowed to take off. These delays accumulate and cause further delays.</p>\n<p><strong>Data on Domestic Flight Delays in 2019-2021</strong></p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://ncaa.gov.ng/media-center/news/2021-executive-summary-on-international-and-domestic-flight-operations/\">annual report</a> published by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, 74,537 domestic flights were operated in 2021 which conveyed 12,050,264 passengers. 41,328 (55%) domestic flights were delayed while 542 flights were cancelled. Air peace, Overland, Azman, Dana, Max Air, and Arik Airlines had over 55% of their flights delayed in Nigeria in 2021.</p>\n<p>In 2019, 65,401 domestic flights were operated according to the annual report published by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority. 37,510 domestic flights were delayed while 356 flights were cancelled.</p>\n<p><strong>Domestic Flights Delayed in 2019-2021</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Hq9ATYooPVpAWCEs\"></figure><p><strong>Data on International Flight Delays 2019–2021</strong></p>\n<p>In 2021, a total of 9,675 international flights were operated according to the annual report published by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.

In Nigeria, debt is growing faster than GDP. This has become a growing concern for Nigerians and for international investors who are discouraged for fear of overtaxation to service debt. This research looks into Nigeria’s debt, its sustainability and its impact on the Nigerian economy; as well as its effect on Nigerian entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>The Obasanjo Administration met the accumulated foreign debt at $28 billion and left $2.1 billion in 2007. The Yar’adua administration that followed in 2007 left an additional $1.39 billion and the Jonathan administration incurred an additional $7.3 billion when the administration came to an end in 2015. It is important to point out that in 2006 Nigeria obtained debt forgiveness. The Obasanjo administration paid $18 billion to secure forgiveness of its $28 billion debts to the London and Paris clubs of creditors. This act was a redeeming act which significantly lowered the nation’s debt.</p>\n<p>According to a report published by the Debt Management Office Nigeria (DMO), the current total public debt as at September 30, 2021 stands at a staggering $92 billion, with its Naira equivalent at ₦38 trillion having external debt at $37 billion and domestic debt at $54 billion. This is currently Nigeria’s highest recorded debt and it surpasses the combined debt of the past three Administrations.</p>\n<p>This development has led to a lot of conversations with one side believing that the current debt is sustainable and may still become something positive if the government is able to keep the debt-to-GDP stable. The other side is of the opinion that the high debt value is running the economy to the ground. Trading Economics predicted a debt-to-GDP of around 36% for Nigeria in 2022 and today the debt-to-GDP is at 34.98% from a previous 29.10%. Evidently the debt-to-GDP is approaching the threshold where it may no longer be sustainable and could ultimately create critical issues for the Nigerian economy.</p>\n<p>To put things in perspective, Nigeria is currently ranked 5th by The World Bank on the list of 10 countries with the highest debt exposure. The question on everyone’s mind is ‘How will this debt impact businesses and the economy at large?’</p>\n<p><strong>The Effects of Debt on The Economy</strong></p>\n<p>1. The burden of inflation:Debt leads to increased taxation for corporations which in turn leads to increased prices on products and services for citizens. Increased prices on products on services ends up burdening the economy with inflation.</p>\n<p>2. The burden of capital accumulation:The heavy debt burden leads to the country’s output being used to service debt rather than towards productive endeavours like infrastructure and economic growth.</p>\n<p>3. The burden of repaying debts: When the government runs a deficit and needs to borrow money, interest rates are likely to go up. As a result, private investment may not grow as quickly or as reasonably as they should, which could in turn, hamper economic growth. . Reckless use of public funds exacerbates this problem.</p>\n<p>According to a report by the Debt Management Office, DMO, Nigeria’s debt is currently at $92 billion, as at September, 2021, with a GDP of $432 billion and a debt-to-GDP of 34.98%. Economic theory suggests that reasonable levels of borrowing by a developing country may enhance its economic growth, however if a country’s debt level surpasses the nation’s debt repayment ability, expected debt servicing will become an increasing share of the country’s future output level. However, even though Nigeria’s debt situation is far below the borrowing levels of some developed countries like the US, and the UK, the World Bank, and other international monetary institutions, do not seem to show confidence in Nigeria’s ability to delicately handle such robust debts.</p>\n<p>The United States economy is proof that this theory is accurate. The United States currently has a debt-to-GDP of 124.72% and has its national debt at just over $30 trillion but has continued to sustain its economy, recording an unemployment rate of 4% contrast to Nigeria’s 33.3%. Despite the US being in 3000x more debt than Nigeria and having a debt-to-GDP 3.5x above Nigeria’s. The US economy has grown more, experienced less inflation, more infrastructure and lower poverty levels, than the Nigerian economy has.</p>\n<p>In Nigeria, despite the steady increase in public debt the stats show that economic growth has remained low with increasing levels of poverty. Since the 2016 recession Nigeria has struggled with a higher debt service to revenue ratio. Recent data in Nigeria shows a rapid increase in government debt and debt service payments, despite lower growth rates and increasing poverty rates. This is of concern to researchers and policy analysts.</p>\n<p>Some of the world’s strongest economies are also operating with high national debt. This also applies to certain economies across Africa. But some of these economies have been able to sustain their debt and build on that.</p>\n<p><strong>GDP to National Debt (Billions)</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4-nrw5stuT5bU74BjaWC3A.png\"><figcaption><strong>GDP to National Debt (Billions)</strong></figcaption></figure><p>From our study, the UAE economy has economic similarities with the Nigerian economy; the UAE’s national debt is currently at $113 billion, relative with Nigeria’s $92 billion; with the UAE’s GDP of $421 billion, in contrast to Nigeria’s GDP of $432 billion.</p>\n<p>Per the Global Competitiveness Report 2019, the UAE was ranked 1st regionally and 25th globally in infrastructure. In 2019 the UAE had a federal budget of $16.3 billion with particular focus on citizens’ well-being, health and education. The approved budget for the UAE in 2022 is a total sum of $15.7 billion with 41.2% allocated to the development and social sectors; that is health, education, pensions, social development etc. 3.8% of the budget has also been allocated to infrastructural growth. With inflation at 2.5% and unemployment at 5%, the UAE is one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in the world.</p>\n<p>With relatively similar debt to Nigeria and a slightly lower GDP, it is a wonder to economists how Nigeria is still far behind with respect to infrastructure, social development and economic growth. Out of 137 countries, Nigeria was ranked 132nd in infrastructure, 136th in health and education and 122nd in macroeconomic environment. This ranking was collated by the Global Competitiveness Index 2017–2018 Edition.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Nigeria had a federal budget of $35 billion with $2.7 billion going into infrastructure. The proposed 2022 budget is $38 billion with $3.3 billion allocated to infrastructure and a cumulative $12.2 billion to security, education and infrastructure. The 2021 budget had specifically focused on infrastructure, security and human capital development, however studies show, there is no evidence of growth in either of those sectors and the economy continues to decline.</p>\n<p>Clearly unsustainable public debt is discouraging investment in Nigeria and reducing its growth, global competitiveness, and financial markets are more susceptible to global shocks. The existing debt has led to investors driving up interest rates, lowering disposable income and increasing wages. Resulting in a reduction in profitability of businesses and by extension, a reduction in private investment.</p>\n<p>A report published by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that Foreign Direct Investment fell by 49.6% in the second quarter of 2021, the lowest in 11 years. It is evident that Nigeria’s debt is an impediment on private businesses, more especially tech start-ups who rely primarily on foreign investment.</p>\n<p>In January, 2022 the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osibanjo disclosed that the Federal Government would be launching an initiative that would focus on the poor. This initiative is supposedly to be powered by a loan from The World Bank. This loan is said to come up to ₦311 trillion Naira and will be for two years (2021–2023).</p>\n<p>While some economists believe that Nigeria’s debt may still be sustainable on the basis that the current debt-to-GDP is not too high, and is sustainable, others believe that the economy will continue to decline because all output will continue to be used for debt service with nothing going into the country’s infrastructure. Potential investors will also be discouraged for fear that the more production there is, the more they will be taxed by the government so as to service public debt.</p>\n<p>Inflation and Unemployment are also reflections of the strength of an economy and here a comparison is drawn between these global economies and Nigeria with regards to inflation and unemployment rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Inflation and Unemployment Rate (%)</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gtPryZCefeiQNdJkpjzraQ.png\"><figcaption>Inflation &amp; Unemployment Rate</figcaption></figure><p>A report by The Conversation Africa, suggested that the government needs to promote economic growth by investing in infrastructure, especially roads and electricity as this will provide access to capital for small and medium sized enterprises and will support agricultural development.</p>\n<p>The key factors contributing to Nigeria’s growing debt include: rapid growth in public spending, particularly on capital projects, borrowing from the international community at non-occasional interest rates, a decline in oil earnings beginning in the late 1970s, and an increased reliance on imports, all of which contributed to the emergence of trade arrears.This research also highlights that the economy is and has always been particularly reliant on oil as its primary income source and there is a need to branch out or diversify.</p>\n<p>Since 2015, Nigeria’s debt has been on an aggressive, upward spiral. This development has led to a large percentage of Nigeria’s revenue going into debt servicing. However despite Nigeria’s debt burden, it has not lost its borrowing capacity as several institutions and countries are still willing to loan Nigeria money. In 2015, Nigeria used 31% of its revenue to service debt.</p>\n<p>According to this chart by Dataphyte, the debt service ratio was over 50% in 2019. However, between 2020 and 2021, the debt servicing ratio has shot up more significantly, with the debt servicing ratio hitting an all time high of 97.78% from a revenue of $9.6 billion. The figure dropped to 86.98% in the first half of 2021. This drop which would have been a relief was not because 86.98% is still an alarmingly high figure for servicing debt.</p>\n<p>Debt servicing is the most challenging effect of Nigeria’s debt burden and a major stumbling block to economic growth. This is because a great percentage of Nigeria’s revenue continues to be used to service debt rather than infrastructural, social and economic growth; and with debt servicing, the economy remains in an unending cycle of greater debt. The possible way out of this debt quagmire would be reducing borrowing to produce more, i.e. lightly borrowing (with fairer terms) for industrialisation, technology, education and export. If the country can focus on internal development and growth, the economy could be strengthened to improve unemployment, inflation and infrastructure, rather than be burdened by unending debt.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a6ddac54dca5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

But some of these economies have been able to sustain their debt and build on that.</p>\n<p><strong>GDP to National Debt (Billions)</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4-nrw5stuT5bU74BjaWC3A.png\"><figcaption><strong>GDP to National Debt (Billions)</strong></figcaption></figure><p>From our study, the UAE economy has economic similarities with the Nigerian economy; the UAE’s national debt is currently at $113 billion, relative with Nigeria’s $92 billion; with the UAE’s GDP of $421 billion, in contrast to Nigeria’s GDP of $432 billion.</p>\n<p>Per the Global Competitiveness Report 2019, the UAE was ranked 1st regionally and 25th globally in infrastructure. In 2019 the UAE had a federal budget of $16.3 billion with particular focus on citizens’ well-being, health and education. The approved budget for the UAE in 2022 is a total sum of $15.7 billion with 41.2% allocated to the development and social sectors; that is health, education, pensions, social development etc. 3.8% of the budget has also been allocated to infrastructural growth. With inflation at 2.5% and unemployment at 5%, the UAE is one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in the world.</p>\n<p>With relatively similar debt to Nigeria and a slightly lower GDP, it is a wonder to economists how Nigeria is still far behind with respect to infrastructure, social development and economic growth. Out of 137 countries, Nigeria was ranked 132nd in infrastructure, 136th in health and education and 122nd in macroeconomic environment. This ranking was collated by the Global Competitiveness Index 2017–2018 Edition.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Nigeria had a federal budget of $35 billion with $2.7 billion going into infrastructure. The proposed 2022 budget is $38 billion with $3.3 billion allocated to infrastructure and a cumulative $12.2 billion to security, education and infrastructure. The 2021 budget had specifically focused on infrastructure, security and human capital development, however studies show, there is no evidence of growth in either of those sectors and the economy continues to decline.</p>\n<p>Clearly unsustainable public debt is discouraging investment in Nigeria and reducing its growth, global competitiveness, and financial markets are more susceptible to global shocks. The existing debt has led to investors driving up interest rates, lowering disposable income and increasing wages. Resulting in a reduction in profitability of businesses and by extension, a reduction in private investment.</p>\n<p>A report published by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that Foreign Direct Investment fell by 49.6% in the second quarter of 2021, the lowest in 11 years. It is evident that Nigeria’s debt is an impediment on private businesses, more especially tech start-ups who rely primarily on foreign investment.</p>\n<p>In January, 2022 the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osibanjo disclosed that the Federal Government would be launching an initiative that would focus on the poor. This initiative is supposedly to be powered by a loan from The World Bank. This loan is said to come up to ₦311 trillion Naira and will be for two years (2021–2023).</p>\n<p>While some economists believe that Nigeria’s debt may still be sustainable on the basis that the current debt-to-GDP is not too high, and is sustainable, others believe that the economy will continue to decline because all output will continue to be used for debt service with nothing going into the country’s infrastructure. Potential investors will also be discouraged for fear that the more production there is, the more they will be taxed by the government so as to service public debt.</p>\n<p>Inflation and Unemployment are also reflections of the strength of an economy and here a comparison is drawn between these global economies and Nigeria with regards to inflation and unemployment rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Inflation and Unemployment Rate (%)</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gtPryZCefeiQNdJkpjzraQ.png\"><figcaption>Inflation &amp; Unemployment Rate</figcaption></figure><p>A report by The Conversation Africa, suggested that the government needs to promote economic growth by investing in infrastructure, especially roads and electricity as this will provide access to capital for small and medium sized enterprises and will support agricultural development.</p>\n<p>The key factors contributing to Nigeria’s growing debt include: rapid growth in public spending, particularly on capital projects, borrowing from the international community at non-occasional interest rates, a decline in oil earnings beginning in the late 1970s, and an increased reliance on imports, all of which contributed to the emergence of trade arrears.This research also highlights that the economy is and has always been particularly reliant on oil as its primary income source and there is a need to branch out or diversify.</p>\n<p>Since 2015, Nigeria’s debt has been on an aggressive, upward spiral. This development has led to a large percentage of Nigeria’s revenue going into debt servicing. However despite Nigeria’s debt burden, it has not lost its borrowing capacity as several institutions and countries are still willing to loan Nigeria money. In 2015, Nigeria used 31% of its revenue to service debt.</p>\n<p>According to this chart by Dataphyte, the debt service ratio was over 50% in 2019. However, between 2020 and 2021, the debt servicing ratio has shot up more significantly, with the debt servicing ratio hitting an all time high of 97.78% from a revenue of $9.6 billion. The figure dropped to 86.98% in the first half of 2021. This drop which would have been a relief was not because 86.98% is still an alarmingly high figure for servicing debt.</p>\n<p>Debt servicing is the most challenging effect of Nigeria’s debt burden and a major stumbling block to economic growth. This is because a great percentage of Nigeria’s revenue continues to be used to service debt rather than infrastructural, social and economic growth; and with debt servicing, the economy remains in an unending cycle of greater debt. The possible way out of this debt quagmire would be reducing borrowing to produce more, i.e. lightly borrowing (with fairer terms) for industrialisation, technology, education and export. If the country can focus on internal development and growth, the economy could be strengthened to improve unemployment, inflation and infrastructure, rather than be burdened by unending debt.</p>\n<img class='hidden-img' src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a6ddac54dca5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

This loan will be used by oil marketers to convert over 7,000 retail outlets/filling stations to autogas stations to encourage the use of gas in vehicles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The government will also provide 50% of the conversion kits to fast-track the process and also meet their target of converting 200,000 commercial vehicles to run on gas this year.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lagos State Government is also collaborating with the Federal Government to develop autogas filling stations in the State through the inauguration of the Ibile Oil & Gas Corporation Gas Plant in Ikorodu, Lagos.</p>\n<p><strong>How will the use of autogas affect businesses in Nigeria?</strong></p>\n<p>Gas-based industries, especially petrochemicals such as fertilizer and methanol would also develop rapidly to support large industries like agriculture. This will help foster investment from the private sector; which will then be encouraged to invest in the domestic gas market. Which should in turn foster more employment opportunities.</p>\n<p>This will also be economical for the government as a result of the abundance of gas. When local industries and vehicles are converted to autogas, there will be less demand for petrol, so the government can export more oil and import less refined petroleum products.</p>\n<p>The utilisation of gas will enable oil companies to stop gas flaring. As a result, they will no longer pay gas flaring penalties/fines to the government thereby reducing their cost of production. Also, oil and gas industries such as Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) will experience expansion in operation leading to an increase in revenue and employment opportunities.</p>\n<p>While the government must provide certain incentives and investments to increase gas utilisation in Nigeria, the government still needs to invest in new pipelines and other gas processing and storage infrastructures.</p>\n",

Since then, there has been a multitude of trends that have developed and are changing the way businesses operate and are managed today.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the Startup trends to look out for in 2022:</p>\n<p><strong>Remote Work:</strong> Remote work started out as a necessity in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and it has since become a trending business model in tech companies and a lot of Start-ups. As of May 20, 2021, the percentage of paid job postings on LinkedIn offering “remote work” has skyrocketed to 357% beyond the earlier year. Remote work now accounts for 26.8% of all paid job listings. It would appear that what started as a necessary evil has now become a high demand business trend with job seekers opting for remote jobs. This is a trend we certainly will continue to see more of in 2022 and quite possibly after.</p>\n<p><strong>Virtualisation of Business:</strong> Not unrelated to remote work is the digitisation of businesses. This covers the use of artificial intelligence heavily in businesses as well as the lean toward digital currency and virtual recruitment and onboarding processes.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence may be unable to tackle common sense tasks but it is able to analyse and process data far more quickly than the human brain. It is able to deliver the right information to the right customer, aids in scheming out the consequences of each action and generally helps to streamline the decision making process.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Digital currency is not a new phenomenon in the business world but 2020 and 2021 brought about more global reliance on cryptocurrency with quite a large number of the global population now making investments and savings in cryptocurrency as well as financial transactions. 2022 will not be any different as more businesses will need to deal in crypto in the form of transactions but primarily having it as an accepted mode of payment.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Increased Online Presence:</strong> Every company or firm today is striving to establish social media presence of some sort, by creating a presence on apps like LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter companies seek to partake in the digital boom. Several companies now employ people to operate in such capacities with roles like social media managers, Digital media strategists, content writers and creators. Essentially globalization is causing every company in the world to adapt to the changing times.</p>\n<p><strong>Talent Priotisation:</strong> In the startup space there is an increasing demand for fresh talent. Hence skill is top priority. With the introduction of online courses and certifications, people are able to learn and specialise in several areas such as data analysis, cyber security etc without necessarily having degrees in those areas. Essentially the question is no longer ‘Do you have a degree in this area?’ But now ‘How skilled are you at it?’ By being inclusive and not rigid in recruitment processes, startups allow for people with actual talent and passion to gain the necessary opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion Hiring:</strong> ‘Inclusion’ is a term that has been floating around in every form of media since 2019, inclusion of races, genders, sexual orientations and identities and ethnicities. This has been and still is an ongoing conversation and trend in the business world. Now more than ever, business are being intentional about inclusivity and diversity with companies setting up roles specifically for women and ensuring racial and ethnic diversity in their recruitment processes. This is a trend that we will probably be seeing more of in 2022.</p>\n",
